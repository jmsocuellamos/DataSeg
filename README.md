## BD1. Crímenes en Berlin (Berlin_crimes.csv)

Berlin is a special city, multicultural city. And the crime image is special there. For example there are no bloody 
drug wars, ghetto or neighborhoods where police afraid to get. Crimes like "deprivation of liberty" and "treat" are in 
one column. But "larceny" - separated to 4 categories: theft of bikes, of auto, from auto (sic!) and rest kind of theft. 
Particular column for "Damage to property due graffiti" (Sach-beschädigung durch Graffiti (sic!). Numbers of crimes are 
connected with every single neighborhood of Berlin's part. Statistics covering period of 2012 - 2019 years.

Questions to community:
1) what part of Berlin is most dangerous?
2) what crimes are growing?
3) what crimes are going low?

## BD4. Asesinatos cometidos por policias en EEUU (PoliceKillingsUS.csv)

The 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, began the protest movement culminating in Black Lives Matter and an increased focus on police accountability nationwide. 

Since Jan. 1, 2015, The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. It's difficult to find reliable data from before this period, as police killings haven't been comprehensively documented, and the statistics on police brutality are much less available. As a result, a vast number of cases go unreported.

The Washington Post is tracking more than a dozen details about each killing - including the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. They have gathered this information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as "Killed by police" and "Fatal Encounters". The Post has also conducted additional reporting in many cases.
