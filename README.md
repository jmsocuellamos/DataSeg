## BD1. Crímenes en Berlin (Berlin_crimes.csv)

Berlin is a special city, multicultural city. And the crime image is special there. For example there are no bloody 
drug wars, ghetto or neighborhoods where police afraid to get. Crimes like "deprivation of liberty" and "treat" are in 
one column. But "larceny" - separated to 4 categories: theft of bikes, of auto, from auto (sic!) and rest kind of theft. 
Particular column for "Damage to property due graffiti" (Sach-beschädigung durch Graffiti (sic!). Numbers of crimes are 
connected with every single neighborhood of Berlin's part. Statistics covering period of 2012 - 2019 years.

Questions to community:
1) what part of Berlin is most dangerous?
2) what crimes are growing?
3) what crimes are going low?
